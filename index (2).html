 <h2>What’s Naruto About?</h2>



    <p>The story is about Naruto Uzumaki, who’s treated like an outcast due to the sealed monster inside him, the Nine-Tailed Fox. To be recognized by his village, Naruto dreams of becoming the Leaf Village’s Hokage. Throughout the series, you’ll see Naruto grow as a ninja and encounter several enemies along his path to achieve his dream.</p>

<p>These enemies include powerful ninjas, like Orochimaru, or evil organizations, such as the infamous Akatsuki. With the Nine-Tails inside him, the Akatsuki seeks to obtain his power through any means necessary for their own benefit. As they try to achieve their goal, the Akatsuki’s pursuit will cause a lot of bloodshed and destruction.
For most of the story, Naruto is also set on bringing back Sasuke, a comrade of his who decided to leave their village. As much as Sasuke tries to sever their bond, Naruto does everything he can to tie it back up. If you follow this story, Naruto will take you on a ride filled with action, loss, and growth on his journey to become Hokage.</p>
 


<h2>Who was naruto made by?</h2>


<p>Naruto was written and illustrated by a man named Masashi Kishimoto. His work was initially published in Shueisha’s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1999. Afterward, the manga was given an anime adaptation by Studio Pierrot in 2002, which aired for over 5 years before being followed by Naruto: Shippuden.
 
Originally, Kishimoto wanted Naruto to be a chef, but that version never saw the light of day. Instead, he wrote a one-shot for Naruto with a different story issued in Akamaru Jump back in 1997. Later on, Kishimoto rewrote the story into the one we know today.
The First Version of Naruto Wasn't a Ninja 
 Naruto's prototype lived up to his name. </p>
 


<H2>Who are the main characters in Naruto?</H2>

 <p>The main character Naruto is a wild young boy who always likes to cause trouble and do all sorts of antics. Even though he’s poorly treated due to the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto wants to prove himself by becoming Hokage. Throughout his life, Naruto will meet more characters you’ll also get to know over time.
One character who largely impacted his life is Sasuke Uchiha, Naruto’s fellow Team 7 member. Their rivalry led to many memorable battles and story arcs that became crucial turning points for the show. Other characters also became great mentors to Naruto, such as Kakashi Hatake and Jiraiya. Meanwhile, in the latest series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, the spotlight was given to Naruto’s son instead, Boruto Uzumaki.</p>

 
<h2>Whats the difference between all the series?</h2>


<p>Over the years, Kishimoto and Studio Pierrot created three different Naruto series. The first one was “Naruto,” which covered Part 1 of the manga and released more than 200 episodes during its five-year run. It focused on the early days of Naruto’s life as a ninja, along with developing the characters and the story.
Meanwhile, Naruto: Shippuden served as a sequel to Naruto, following a two-and-a-half-year time skip in their world due to Naruto’s training with Jiraiya. It released 500 episodes in 10 years, adapting Part 2 of the manga. Shippuden is where things start to kick off, introducing more Akatsuki members and heavily increasing the power scale. The stakes are also higher this time around compared to the first installment.</p>
 


<h2>Where can i watch Naruto?</h2>



<p>Due to its popularity, you can watch Naruto on multiple streaming platforms like <li><p>Crunchyroll,</p></li> <li><P>Netflix,</P></li> <li><p>Hulu,</p><li><p>and Funimation.</p></li>
    
<p>However, some regions might not have access to some of these due to licensing issues, so you may need a VPN. It’ll be worth the subscription since you’ll watch one of the greatest anime.
